# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The Alphabet Soup Charity was interested in developing a machine learning algorithm that used neural networks to determine the success of giving money to an organization based off of more than 34,000 previous recipients of funding from Alphabet Soup. The organization was interested in being able to identify if an applicant would effectively use the money that was given to them using this algorithm to optimize who they gave funding to.

## Results:

# Data Preprocessing

Variable considered the target for the model:

The target variable for the model is comes from the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column as either a yes or a no (1 or 0). This is determined by whether or not the money given to the organization was used effectively.

Variable(s) that are considered to be the features for the model:
- Application Type
- Affiliation
- Classification
- Use Case
- Organization
- Income Amount
- Special Considerations
- Ask Amount

Variables that are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data:
- EIN
- Name
- Status

# Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?


Were you able to achieve the target model performance?


What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
